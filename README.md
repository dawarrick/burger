# Eat-Da-Burger
### Full stack application that allows for entering and devouring burgers of your choice.

### Developed by Deb Warrick https://debwarrick.com

#### Eat-Da-Burger is a Node.js application using the Express web application framework, MySQL, Express-Handlebars, and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) for SQL processing.
#### It is deployed on Heroku at https://git.heroku.com/pure-chamber-83496.git and uses the JawsDB remote access add-on for database connectivity.

### How it works

* The user will be shown a list of burgers in the database.

* If there is a button labeled "Devour It" next to the burger (left side of the screen), then it has not yet been eaten.  
* If you click on the "Devour It" button, it will be devoured and moved to the right side of the screen without a button.

* There is an entry field and an "Add Burger" button at the bottom of the screen to allow you to add new burgers.

* You may ask yourself, what exactly is the point of this game?? I too had that question...

* The purpose was for me to learn how to get all these new technologies to work together, which was a challenge, so they kept the app simple.
